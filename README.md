Here we are trying create a platfrom in which all local sevice providers can work with the local people in digital mode.
A service provider website is a platform that connects customers with professionals who offer a variety of services, such as housecleaning, electrical work, plumbing, and medical care. Customers can browse through the website to find a service provider in their area who offers the service they need. Many service provider websites also allow customers to read reviews and ratings from other customers to help them choose the best professional for their needs. Once a customer has found a service provider they would like to work with, they can contact them through the website to schedule an appointment or request more information. Service provider websites make it easy for customers to find and connect with trusted professionals who can help them with their home, health, and other needs.![logo-color](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113111710/211173520-657019d5-dfc9-4530-aa16-f17adfb6f208.png)
